This is the Password Generator project from Scrimba(https://scrimba.com/fullstack-path-c0fullstack/~07p).
The technologies used are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The project consists of a container having a button and 2 boxes that are generating random passwords on-click through javascript.
It features a password length slider and the ability to chose whether the next generated password/s
contains at least one type of element(eg. "uppercase", "lowercase", "numbers", "symbols") or more.

The project status is DONE.

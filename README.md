This is the Password Generator project from Scrimba(https://scrimba.com/fullstack-path-c0fullstack/~07p).
The technologies used are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The project consists of 2 containers generating random passwords through javascript.

The project is still on going, so far only the design part is done. 

```
    Currently working on the JavaScript section.
```

Future stretch goals:
- ability to set password length;
- copy "on-click" feature;
- toggle "symbols" and "numbers" on/off
